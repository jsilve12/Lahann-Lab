							<h4>Introduction:</h4>
							<p class = "research-description">Surface modification of complex substrates has emerged as a key challenge in many applications. In this respect, vaporbased polymer coatings have garnered a lot attention as compared to wet-chemical approaches and are applicable to a diverse range of polymerizations. However, these coatings have been hampered by the lack of anchor groups and reactive functionalities for further surface modification.</p>
							<h4>Technology:</h4>
							<p>We	have	developed	a	novel	vapor-based	surface	modification	technique	using	chemical vapor	deposition	polymerization.	This	deposition	process	creates	a	layer	of	ultra-thin reactive polymeric	film	onto	the	substrates	surfaces.	The	reacting	coatings	are	made	of	poly-p-xyxlene	containing	functional	anchor	moieties.	The	deposition	process	does	not	require the	use	of any	solvents/initiators,	making	it	a	bio-compatible	process	for	various biomedical	applications.	The	coating	typically	has	a	thickness	in	the	nm	to	Î¼m	range	and can	be	applied	to	any surfaces	and	to	complex	3-dimensional	geometries.	Our	custom-built CVD	system	has	also	enabled	us	to	create	polymer	coatings	which	present	multiple functional	groups	simultaneously, as	well	as	polymer	gradients.	We	have	further demonstrated	the	applicability	of	these	coatings	towards	biomimetic	and	spatially-directed	surface	engineering.</p>
